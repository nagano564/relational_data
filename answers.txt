1)

  The RubyGems software allows you to easily download, install, and use ruby
software packages on your system. The software package is called a “gem” which
contains a packaged Ruby application or library. I would use a gems because it
can be used to extend or modify functionality in Ruby applications.
Commonly they’re used to distribute reusable functionality that is shared with
other Rubyists for use in their applications and libraries.
Some gems provide command line utilities to help automate tasks and speed up your work

2)
  Lazy loading is a type of design pattern, which means an object isn't
  calculated until the first time it is needed. Eager loading initializes an
  object upon creation.

3)
  CREATE TABLE will do exactly that create the table. INSERT INTO tablename will
  insert values into 'tablename'

4)
   Use include for instance methods and extend for class methods.
   Also, it is sometimes ok to use include to add both instance and class methods.

5)
  Save should be a instance method because it is an save is an instance on the
  class. Meaning your not creating something from the class but your saving a single
  occurrence of the class. Not creating a class

6)
  UPDATE table_name
  SET name = "new_name"
  WHERE name = "old_name";

7)
  def camel_case
    return self if self !~ /_/ && self =~ /[A-Z]+.*/
    split('_').map{|e| e.capitalize}.join
  end
